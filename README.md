# calculator
A simple online calculator in homework1 

The calculator will contain 15 clickable buttons: a button for each digit 0 to 9, and +, -, ร, รท, and =. I seperated button into two classes: digit and operator.

Every buttons have rounded corners.

Digit buttons have a different color than operator buttons.

My calculator displays zero that the user may not directly edit. 

When the user hovers over a button, its color will change.
